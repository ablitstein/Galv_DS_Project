The question:how can we use a Customer Relationship Management system to better improve customer retention, and product referral

I sought out a data set to better answer this question, and I found the Yelp data set, hundreds of thousands of businesses with millions of reviews.

In order to improve customer retention, and referral I sought find 2 key indicators:

What am I doing well?
What should i improve/remove?

I created this Yelp analysis dashboard, in it, it gives the most common texts that are featured in positive reviews, and those that are common in negative reviews,

in addition, to better understand the experiences of the happy customer, vs the unhappy customer, I have used sentiment analysis, to pull out 2 reviews that best describe all the key points identified

While this has been done with the yelp dataset, this process can be implemented with different data sets in the future, to help businesses better understand their customer.
